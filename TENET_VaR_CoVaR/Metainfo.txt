Description: 'Estimates the Value at Risks (VaRs) of 100 financial institutions
using moving window estimation based on seven macro state variables. The plot shows 
the log returns of JP Morgan (black points) and VaR of JP Morgan (red line) as an 
example. The estimated CoVaR by using Single-Index Model with LASSO (blue line) and 
estimated CoVaR using linear quantile LASSO model(green line) are also plotted as 
comparison.'
